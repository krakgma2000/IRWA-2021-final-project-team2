# IRWA 2021 Final Project Repository

In this repository you will find the code for the UPF IRWA final project from group 2 (Ferran PÃ©rez and Guillem Moreno)

This final project consist on a search engine which implements different indexing and ranking algorithms.

The project has already ended, and it contains a repository as well as all the notebook that we have been using to progress on our search engine.

The full roadmap of the project is the following:
 
 
| Part | Topic | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Text Processing | 29/10/2021 |
| 2 | Indexing and Evaluation | 11/11/2021 |
| 3  | Ranking | 29/11/2021 |
| 4 | User Interface and Web Analytics | 03/12/2021 |

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find different cells that must be executed in order
 - The first cell will install all the necesary libraries that may not be installed in the user environment.
 - The following cells have the necessary imports, functions, and code in order to process the text.
 - After this point, you will find the code for all the different parts of the Final Project

ATENTION! YOU MUST CHANGE THE PATH OF THE INPUT FILE TO THE ONE OF YOUR COMPUTER!

Regarding the final app, you will find a repository that you just need to donwload to your computer. After this, go inside the repository and just run the web_app.py python code in an appropiate virtual environment. The environment must have the following dependencies installed:

* Flask
* matplotlib
* collections
* numpy
* json
* nltk
* num2words

You will find more details about our web application in our report.

Thank you.
